            <p>
                Identify the product whose software requirements are specified in this document,
                including the revision or release number. Describe the scope of the product that is covered by this SRS,
                particularly if this SRS describes only part of the system or a single subsystem.

            <h2> 1.2 Document Conventions </h2>
            <p>
                Describe any standards or typographical conventions that were followed when writing this SRS,
                such as fonts or highlighting that have special significance. For example,
                state whether priorities for higher-level requirements are assumed to be inherited
                by detailed requirements, or whether every requirement statement is to have its own priority.

                such as developers, project managers, marketing staff, users, testers,
                and documentation writers. Describe what the rest of this SRS contains and how it is organized. 
                Suggest a sequence for reading the document, beginning with the overview sections 
                and proceeding through the sections that are most pertinent to each reader type.

                Provide a short description of the software being specified and its purpose,
                including relevant benefits, objectives, and goals.
                Relate the software to corporate goals or business strategies.
                If a separate vision and scope document is available, refer to it rather than duplicating its contents here.

                system requirements specifications, use case documents, or a vision and scope document.
                Provide enough information so that the reader could access a copy of each reference,
